This was another project I developed at school. It is a platforma focused on "grade recovery" at school. Basically if a student has failed at a test, they can recover it by paying (or in some cases for free), and this app manages that. The desktop app is more focused on the management part, only people that work at the school or admins can access it and they can create/modify/delete students and teachers, as well as aprove and give prices to the recoveries. The web version allows both students, teachers and staff to login and each one of them have different functions.

The biggest limitation with this platform is the prices part, where it only allows the user to insert prices that are integral numbers. This is because the database field that saves the values is a float and it is supposed to accept the value in euros, not in cents, the problem with this is because in EU we use "," to separate the decimal part of the number, while in the US people use a ".", so this will only work if the regional settings for both the PC that is using the program and the SQL instance are in the EU. To fix this you would need to change the field in the database and redo a lot of the methods that I created in the WebService.
